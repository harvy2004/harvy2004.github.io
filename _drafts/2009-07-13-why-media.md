Well I like Films and TV shows, especially those with a Sci-Fi twist (which will be strongly apparent) but I also like the all time favourites and even some underdogs. These posts will be about films and TV shows I like and why I like them, a short blurb about what it is about and the ideas it brings up, as every great film (or TV show) tries to put across a unique idea. Even then I just like pure horror or action as some kind form of escapism.

Also now and again I may post some news on my favourite TV shows or upcoming films. For example, what is going to happen to Futurama?!?!
