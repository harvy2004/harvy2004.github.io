<h2>Small screen optimisation</h2>
I never realised how important layout was on mobile devices.

With any kind of layout design on a screen there had to be some thought into the ergonomics and the user journey, this changed when coming to a small screen, especially a small touch screen.

On the iPhone4 it was not much of an issue, my big hand could easily reach most of the screen with just the thumb and no over extending required. With the Nexus 4 things changed. So the 4 in the "Nexus 4" is a bit misleading, it is actually 4.7 inches diagonal and this means I find myself using two hands some of the time. So if an app has a few buttons that are going to be used constantly then you need to place the buttons in a place where the fingers are going to be most of the time.

In an early version of our app, the buttons were placed at the top. This made sense from a visual experience, as the user would logically go through the steps in a downward order. So the eyes would naturally follow down and to the right, as each section is marked off and it would follow the order it would need to filled in. The settings button is also kept in close proximity of the input boxes.

The box below the inputs was the preview window.

In term of practicality it becomes an annoyance, you have to keep moving your hand from the normal resting place at the bottom of the screen to do any meaningful actions.

We moved the buttons to the bottom and put everything on one line, so you move from left to right to complete the actions needed and hopefully all with just your thumb.

Now with the preferences screen, customisation was available but I decided to stick to the stock android Preferences screen for now. This will have to be revised in the future as I begin to add more settings.
