This is a quest, yes probably a dungeons and dragons quest but a quest all the same. It is find the perfect mojito. Now I think I had it once and no it wasn't in some far off country with bikini-clad women and little kids selling cowboy hats. It was right here in our drizzly country. The problem was I can't quite remember if it was amazing as I think it was, kind like watching a movie you watched as a kid and you thought it was awesome but you watch it now and you think 'what the hell?'

<a rel="attachment wp-att-405" href="http://blog.havinderatwal.com/2011/05/mojito-quest/mojito1/"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-405" style="margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 5px;" title="mojito1" src="http://blog.havinderatwal.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/mojito1.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="400" /></a>So this perfect mojito was consumed in a bar in Coventry about 4 years ago, I believe during the summer (it makes sense as mojitos are normally served during that time of year in the U.K). Now there is one thing that I remember was that it was so good it was the only thing I drank for the rest of the night after trying out my usual drinks beforehand. It was so good I got my whole party (as in quest party, not a house party) hooked on it for the night as well. It was so smooth. Many mojitos now, freshly made ones that is, always seem to have the bits running down your neck when you take a sip, either it's the partially grounded mint or the big bits of undissolved sugar. This drink had none of that and I can't think how they did it, as I remember the barkeep grounding the mint and adding the sugar but none of it could be felt as I drank it (so either it was ground up very well or there is a technique to stop it from going through the straw). Now I have thought about going back to the club, as I am still in contact with my friend who was with me and I remember certain aspects of the club but as to whether that same bartender is there or if the club is even there or a whole host of other factors could mean that it won't be the same, so that is one option to go back to the beginning. But by the law of numbers there has to be someone-somewhere who is making this drink how I (think I) had it. So this is my quest at any bar, I happen to be in, I will ask for a mojito and see if I can reach my goal of the smooth mojito.

Now there are some other solutions of course, like making my own or even trying to find out if there are non-barkeeps who make them, these will also be explored in due course.

PS. I am also a martini fan but I am quite comfortable making my own to my specific taste (almost dry in a large martini glass)
