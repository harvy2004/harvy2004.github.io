The blog has moved to its new home /blog (could be worse /b/ anyone?). This is to reflect more of a change of what I want to use my domain for, now it seems my interests have changed and the blogging platform is not good enough anymore. As I have recently purchased a DSLR and want to showcase some of my handiwork. Also in terms of career, I need to showcase what I have done in an attempt to step up my portfolio and web profile. To do this I will be using the home page as a hub to my projects and to showcase some design skills (even though I admit I am not a designer). So I look forward to the changes I am going to make, the content I am going to produce and the endless hours of tinkering I will have. I hope you enjoy it too!
