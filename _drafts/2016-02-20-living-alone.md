A few months ago we moved out of our apartment but only I moved into one. I had made the descion to live alone. <cue dramatic music>

What's the big deal? Well until now I have always lived with people. The longest stint without someone was probably a week or so, if the other housemate went on holiday but even that had the mindset of knowing that someone would be coming back. In this case there is no one coming back, it would just be me on my own. This makes it slightly scary.

The reasons for this, well there is only one really and even that is frought with uncertainity. 

I have always lived with people for two reasons. One security: I do worry about what if you were on your own and something bad happens, it could be anything from falling down the stairs to an electical fire. Having that other person around even if you see them once a day would be good
