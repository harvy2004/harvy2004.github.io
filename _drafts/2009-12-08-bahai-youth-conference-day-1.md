I now have a brilliant opportunity to attend the Baha'i Youth Conference at the University of Warwick at the start of the New Year. So I will be blogging day by day (only 3 days mind) while taking notes and pictures as I go along.  Now this is the first time I will be attending an event like this, so in essence I am a 'Youth Conference' virgin.

Already people are having a bit of confusion over prices and accommodation. See the notes on facebook event.

But another thing is that even though it is a completely open event, there has been no advertising of any kind except within the Baha'i communities(and that was by word of mouth) and even some people are reluctant to invite (not looking at my girlfriend here). So that leads me on to wonder how many non-Baha'is will actually be there? A point I will try and find the answer to while I am there.

Also the workshops look interesting.  It is a shame that you are limited to pick two but the way the it was worded made it sound like it was more of a preference, so I guess that I may not even get those choices or they may even allow us attend more then two. So I will have to wait and see.

The two that I picked were: 'Baha'i Faith and Politics' and 'Healthy Relationships'.

I really wanted to pick 'Running Junior Youth classes' but there was already going to be a presentation on that and hopefully the Animators from my area will attend that anyway. I also realised the workshops are a small part of the whole conference, so I will look forward to the rest of the activities as well.

So coming up is day 1:
