We finally got back to the Edinburugh Fringe Festival after 3 years and it was just as good as the first time.

First I'd recommend a quick look back at my [first visit]({% post_url 2013-09-07-my-fringe-fest %}), it gives a brief overview of what Fringe is and some of the stuff we did there.

On to the shows themselves:

__Thursday Night drop ins__

After driving up Thursday afternoon and a long walk from the train station we have finally arrived at our hotel. The evening started very shakily with some free shows, I figured we need something to whet the appetite.

We saw two comedy shows and a theatre show, which was quite a bit for just a few hours.

One was BattleActs! a copy of "Who's Line Is It Anyway" with 4 budding comedians. There was a lot of audience interaction and it worked well with the improv on show. Later in the same venue we saw our first comedy theatre, Oddity, this was a space themed (a big plus for me) 3 person theatre with some video. This combined Big Brother diary room moments, with some anti-gravity performing. A very good performance with few props and good use of video to break up the scenes.

The end of the night was a walk down Cowgate, full of some interesting bars and the occasional teepee tent full of guitar-toting hippies. The highlight was a converted cowshed bar with a two piece jazz band.

__Bristol improv group__

This was another highlight. I deliberately looked out for an improv group and this was pretty much all they had.Â  It was well worth scoping out early and trying to get good seats is a must as well as being able to project your voice. Audience participation is the key here. And dammit I didn't get a photo or anything, I really need to sort that out. I did manage to get a girl to act like a penguin for the whole show, so I give this a thumbs up.

So improv (look it up)

__Japanese TeminatoL__

After a quick recovery effort (me curled up on a bed eating fish and chips and listening to a podcast waiting for my codeine to kick in) we went to late night comedy showing. Two things drew me to this particular event: One he was Japanese, my fascination with Japan and it's culture knows no bounds. The other was that it mentioned parodied movie trailers. I was sold! We had to trek across the city center battling the Saturday night party foot traffic but after an arduous hill climb we made it to "The White Horse" pub. The first reaction from my housemate, "Is this it?" I proceeded to walk straight in, at this point the iPhone app had my complete trust.The bar to my right and the regular punters sitting on the left didn't sway me, I just pushed through to a small room at the back and the heat just hit me. This was going to be a sweat-fest. An average size (surprisingly not small) Japanese man in a jumpsuit was at the other end of the room.

I though this is not the guy, he was like the usher. Getting people in and finding seats for them. Make friendly chit chat with people around him. By the time I noticed this my body temperature was already screaming no.

__The Oxford Gargoyles__

The final day's main event was a treat for the ears. The Oxford Gargoyles are a Jazz A Capella group. They look like university students but man can they sing. I've heard A Capella before but to see it done live is certainly a treat. They covered a number of their own songs as well having a mega mash-up of some Disney classics. I'm not sure what audience they were aiming at but I guess it didn't matter the quality of their vocal talents just seemed to make the songs look like little play things.

One of the things I found quite significant was how they were placed on the stage, it did add to the stereo effect and they drew up on it create a more dynamic effect. In one song people were stepping back forth to the audience on the two sides of the stage, this raised and lowered the tonal rage both on the left and right. I'm not sure if they were aware of this technically but a lot of thought went in to the choreography, so kudos to those unseen directors.
