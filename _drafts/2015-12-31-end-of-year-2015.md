That was 2015 and what a busy year it has been (still just as amazing).

### Let's begin...

The year started off with a bang. The washing machine broke. I found out a colleague was secretly a famous DJ. Elite Dangerous was taking up a lot of gaming time. This was going to get better.

I always write these with chronology in mind, basically because I'm gong through my calendar as I write this. That's rubbishy though as this would end up being a glorified list with my trying to review tweets from January. Hmmm let's try sections!

## Job
The biggest thing this year for me was moving jobs. Considering I've been in my last one for nearly 4 years and the market has completely changed, hell I've even got a different skill set. This was going to be a arduous task. 

Luckily I had some really good help, my housemate and good friend is in recruitment. He helped a lot, I quickly got accustomed on how to interact with recruiters. How to leverage the best position and promote yourself, so they can put you across in the way you want.

The other side to this is the market in IT. 4 years ago I was struggling to find job specs that wanted the experience I had. Now? I didn't even have a chance to apply, I was immediately inundated with calls and email straight out of the bat. I was seemingly the prefect candidate for most jobs. 
I learned a few things here. Get burners: Create a temporary email address and get another SIM card. I think the IT industry was a special case here but I was just not prepared for the amount of calls and messages I was going to receive. Even now after pulling my CV down from the job sites (yes I checked twice) I'm still getting calls. The recruitment industry is just crazy, they will hound you down until every last drop of blood is taken. I'm just reminded of a cattle market.

I was sad to leave my old company, especially the people I worked with. On the hand there was just no opportunity to push yourself and the industry I was working for didn't allow creativity or passion. It was insurance after all. I moved to a consultancy and now it's much better work, working on new projects  a few times a year (if you are lucky). The pay has to be addressed as well, most programmers probably don't mind as much as other professionals and maybe I was just ignorant about it. I was really underpaid in my last job, even with one recruiting claiming my pay rise to my new job was the biggest she's ever seen. I do feel I am now getting what I deserve in terms of work.

## Hobbies
This is becoming another big year for my other "work". The Manchester Space Programme is turning into a mature organisation. We have managed to secure private funding
