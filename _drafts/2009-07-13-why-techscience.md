I love Science and Technology (I decided not put that in the title as it would make it too long). From a young age I have always had a fascination with how things worked and some kind of comfort knowing that I know that things can work in a logical order. So I tried to learn how everything worked (one mean feat I tell you) from microwaves to car engines to BASIC programming, even social sciences like sociology and psychology. I can't stress it enough I love science!!!!
