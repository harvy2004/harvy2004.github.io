Some of these concepts on this page may not make sense logically, well they don't to me. But they do try to explain my thought process. This is to help understand the meanings behind the posts marked as "Religion."

---- Revise this ----

These post are representations of what I have learned from other people on the appropriate religions, I am not trying to get a view of how the religions should work, I am looking at how they are actually run. As saying something is very different from actually trying to practise it. So while I will try to refer to religious scriptures and official sources to those religions, I am more interested in how people interpret those and how they try to incorporate it in their everyday lives (or not as the case maybe).

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Atheism</span>

While I was brought up in the Sikh religion I never felt as if I believed in God, even from a young age.

I did not have a traumatic event that led me to this belief, it was more like I started off as a neutral and then step-by -step I discovered that there was no need for God to exist.

My Atheism was not solidified until the late teen years of my life but I didn't become vocal about it until university. My reasoning behind being Atheist is that I simply have no reason to believe in God, I believe even if he did exist by whatever means needed to prove that I would still hold him as an insignificant part of my life. He currently holds no major significance to me, nor do I believe there is anyone up there at all. When trying to define my Atheism, yes there are different types I think the closest match is<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agnostic_atheism" target="_blank"> Teapot Atheism</a>(links to an article entitled 'agnostic atheism' but I prefer not to use that) as defined by Richard Dawkins.

But saying that I have come to understand who he is and what he represents to other people and that is what makes it interesting. I respect the idea of God and other people's opinions but I do believe they are betting on the wrong probabilities.

There are a few sub topics about why I don't believe in God which I hope will come out in my posts.

Another reason for not believing in God is the idea of religion, each religion tries to become a way of life and each one teaches that they are the word of God, with some exceptions. But I believe religion is not needed, I think it was invented as a way to control the masses during an earlier time of mankind's history. But I think people do need prayer and other things that most religions teach, like morality. So prayer for example allows people to come to terms with things that are not under their control or that they don't understand,  by allowing God to take over they can release themselves from that burden. I don't think I need that, as I believe everything can be explained...eventually.

As an Atheist I don't have any intention of debunking religion in an outright fashion (well being blatant about it) nor do I have any intention of turning people away from religion, as that decision will have to be the result of a combination of many factors not just my views. I do take religion seriously and the concept of God but I like to question/debate so I can understand more about it but also to make people question their faith so they too can understand more about and hopefully make then a strong believer (or denier) in their respective religion. Basically I don't want people sitting on the fence as they have not made a decision based on lack of knowledge or lack of wanting to learn, I want people to be firm in their beliefs and I hope to do this by questioning their beliefs even if it is from an Atheist point of view (There, that is my rant on humanity and people in general).

With all that in mind I am willing to believe in God, if he can be proven in some way or he shows himself.

Talk about my scepticism.

Talk about the steps to proving God and if he did exist what my reactions would be.

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Sikhism</span>

This was the religion I was born in and it is still the religion I belong to despite my Atheism. I believe that I couldn't give up this religion as it is right for me in so many ways. I can't explain it fully and I admit most of the reasons could be that it is because I have been born in to and raised by it.  One of the things I draw from this religion is that you should fight for what you believe is right, this has been stamped into our history many times and while it has led Sikhs into battle, it was for a just cause and I think that principle is still needed today.

Also charity and the defence for others, which again is highlighted by our history but also taught within the religion itself. So for example, Seva is the idea of selfless service and can be considered anything from helping out in kitchens to helping clean cars to volunteering in old people's homes. Also the Langar hall is a place where anyone can get food and drink, anyone is welcome and all are treated equal as represented by the fact they all have to sit on the floor (barring disabilities, of course). They have also been instances where the Guru's have given up their lives for another religion, the example here is the 'Martyrdom of Guru Tegh Bahadur'

But it is not with controversies and basically bad points. Politics plays a big role in the religion, as does tradition and culture. This is causing a clash with western culture and causing Sikhs to fall into categories of being overtly Sikh or not associating themselves with it all.

But despite all that I am happy and proud to call myself a follower of Sikhism.

My interest in this religion didn't peak until I came to university where I joined the Sikh society. During the first year I didn't attend many events but I did attend the North Sikhi Week (basically an event every day held in different universities). It was there I became interested as I learned why things were practised they way they were (for example the Ardas) and other topics like life after death.

A year later I was the treasurer of the committee where I then attended all the events of the society, then eventually became the senior coordinator. While I still have a lot to learn about my religion, I have experienced other people views and the whole bonding experience of Sikhism. I have also worked for a charity that promotes Anglo-Sikh heritage.

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Baha'i Faith</span>

I discovered the Baha'i Faith at university. It was actually introduced to me by (at the time) a known Sikh Soc acquaintance. I barely knew this person but we got chatting and in a few moments we got into some deep and meaningful conversations about life, the universe and everything. It was during this conversation that he mentioned the Baha'i Faith, at this time he had just started to attend one of their 'study groups.' I asked him his reasoning and it was two-fold. First his flatmate was a Baha'i (nuff said) and second he mentioned that it seem to answer questions that no other religion could answer and it was a very simple religion (now this was some time ago, so I am having a hard time remembering the exact conversation but the gist is there).

Now a side note: During this time I was working in a job, so it was actually convenient for me to drop in from time to time at the Baha'i Center as it was on the way home. But I very rarely attended the study groups due to time constraints . Probably in the whole year I went to about 6 or 7 sessions, considering they had one every week.

Anyway I was intrigued so I decided to tag along, I first went to attend the study group. Since this followed a set path and at the time it was covering subjects that I wasn't interested in, I was recommended to attend the Firesides. These were more flexible as it was more of a discussion group the studying material group but since at that time many more people were attending as newcomers, it served more as an introduction to the Baha'i Faith.. perfect. Debates typically ranged from comparisons to other religions all the way to homosexuality. But the Firesides were short lived and were eventually stopped, the reasons were many but were mainly poor attendance and they were simply too busy.

So that should have been the end but since the tutor from the study group (and the same who hosted the fireside's) seemed to have taken a liking to me, we became good friends and she invited me to other open Baha'i events, most notably 'Naw-Ruz' (Baha'i new year) and a sleepover for fasting (I don't think I can ever fast... ever). Also since I was one of the only non-Baha'is in attendance I was always asking questions which they seemed more then happy to answer and debate. This eventually turned them from being Baha'i friends to just friends. (I think when I remove a categorisation for certain friends, that means they have become much more closer friends).

Finally I actually started dating a Baha'i and now she has become my girlfriend. This has now led to me to discover as much as I can about the Baha'i faith from a different perspective while still keeping a critical view and trying to understand as much as I can. It also helps that you always have someone on hand to answer your questions.

For the record I am not a Baha'i nor am I considering becoming one.
