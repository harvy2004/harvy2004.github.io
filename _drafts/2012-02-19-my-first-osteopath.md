I've decided to go down the alternative route and privately see an osteopath.

So a bit of history: I have had back trouble for over a year and I was (eventually) diagnosed with a prolapsed disk. It's been a year and half since my first (in a way) symptoms and yes it has taken a long time for treatment and go down the rabbit hole that is the NHS. Also my moving about the country didn't help.

So during the that time I have learned a lot about the NHS and how the procedures work and how different they are from Trust to Trust (which is quite surprising). So as I post more about this I will probably recap on the previous events.

So back to the osteopath.

I'm a sceptical guy and I don't like the idea of alternative medicine, especially ones I consider outlandish like reiki and acupuncture (there you go I said it). So what happened with the osteopath?

Well two things: One is time. I have recently transferred up to Manchester and it has taken 6 months to get to see a specialist and I mean see in the loosest sense of the word (more on that later). So during that time I toyed with the idea of seeing an osteopath to see on the off chance that they could do something that the time-spent NHS couldn't.

The second was other peoples accounts. Now with acupunture its just needles being poked in the body but with osteopathy they are physically manipulating the body. So I guess as lame as it sounds, the idea that someone is physically moving you, to try and sort out a problem sounds better then pins and holy water. A lot of other people have told me they get positive results from seeing an osteo or chiropracter much more then ones that have told about other forms of more dubious, obscure medicine.

Some other reasons is that the NHS do refer to osteopaths for some treatments and osteo's get certified by a large body (for example my osteo was trained at the<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_College_of_Osteopathic_Medicine"> oldest and most well established college</a> in Europe)

So my first visit was a consultation: He took a history and informed me that depending on how I respond to different tests he may or may not give me treatment.Â  I was a bit dubious as to how many people he has actually turned away, I guess I could ask. Next he took me through the (physical) motions, now this is a standard procedure to asses for neurological problems which in most cases is a major symptom of a prolapsed disk.

I have been through quite lot of these with different specialists on the NHS and my osteo pretty much did the same thing. So he gets points for that. At the end he announce that I do have a prolapsed disk. Now bear in mind I have already told him I was already diagnosed with an MRI that I did have one. So I am not sure if he was confirming that or he was implying that from his test of about 10 minutes he worked that out. Either way I couldn't see anything out of the ordinary.

Next was the deep massages, this could be the turning point between NHS and private. Now the physio (of which I saw on the NHS) did this to me for one session. The deep massage is reduce the muscle spasm/tension and correct my posture. A quick crash course : so from the alamaged information from both my physio and osteo, it works like this: I have a prolapsed disk which causes pain and then my body compensates by adjusting my posture when I walk or sit to reduce that pain. Now over time that causes stress on certain muscle groups which cause them to spasm under direct pressure or strained under everyday use.Now this is where the body is now causing more harm then good even though it is acting it's best interests. So the idea is to get a combination of both moving my disk back to its original shape and reduce the muscle tension then all should be well. This is where my physio left me before I moved away.

Now my physio tried to give me a deep tissue massage to reduce that tension and then checked my response to that by testing my flexion (how far my leg can stretch up) and other measures. Now she concluded that it didn't work and I should concentrate on my exercises as they would have a better effect. My osteo however concluded that just a brief session of direct massaging on those groups made my posture change, so he confirmed that it does work (I haven't told him that the physio did any of this, by the way). So has my posture changed and is it enough to be considered treatment? I can't really say. He also left me with a simple exercise to isolate and stretch those muscle groups.

I can't help but get the feeling that he may try and take me for a ride, even though I know he hasn't done anything that seems to indicate for now. The science he speaks matches up with the NHS and the only difference is a slight change in treatment. So for now I will put my sceptical brain to rest.... Until the next time.
