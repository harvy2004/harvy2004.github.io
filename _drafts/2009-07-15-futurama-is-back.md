Thanks to the folks at io9 for confirming this but since this is so far away I am not holding my breath just yet. From what it seems though Futurama is coming back, even though it won't be till next year... Lame.

Now I loved Futurama from the start it was like Family Guy's lost cousin and American Dad's older uncle (whatever either of those references mean). The comedy was coming out in spades there seemed to be more then enough content to go around more then 4 seasons I say and it was based on Sci-Fi (which is always double plus points for me). But then.....

It was axed and then the writers strike came (which just made everything worse) then the dreaded straight-to-DVD (after been shown on TV of course) movies.

I tried and I tried and tried to enjoy the first DVD but no it just wasn't happening, it was as if the shows were meant to be in episode format. So I tried the second DVD and since it was a continuation of the first I didn't get what was going on but it was much better, so I went to the third and then it got bad. I didn't get through the first 20 minutes. So I stopped there and tried to hold on to the good times, like when we meet Leela's parents for the first time, Fry getting his closet space in Bender's apartment or even the first episode that still makes me laugh.

So now here we are, hopefully with the episodes coming back and the good old Planet Express team hopefully going back to their old ways.
