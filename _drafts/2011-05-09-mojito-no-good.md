This was from TGI Fridays in Edgbaston, Birmingham and it wasn't very good. Lots of ice, as expected but when I drank through the straw I'm pretty sure I got mint and sugar crystals coming through at the same time and these sugar crystals felt very big. I had to place the straw halfway down to even get a decent sip, as opposed to the bottom of the glass where the bits seemed to reside. But halfway down was the soda that wasn't mixed in fully. And massive chunky lime pieces, no good!

All in all a bad bad mojito!! I couldn't even finish it.
