Two films that have interested me this month. One trailer I saw this week and another I saw a trailer for a while back.

First up Cold Souls:

<object style="width: 550px; height: 350px;" classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" width="550" height="350" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="play" value="false" /><param name="loop" value="false" /><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/SJ2t2vDfM1M" /><embed style="width: 550px; height: 350px;" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="550" height="350" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/SJ2t2vDfM1M" loop="false" play="false"></embed></object>

Ahhh Mr. Giamatti he is always in weird films. Like that M. Night Shyamalan that we won't talk about. But again this is a good concept, it will be interesting to see how the writers decided what a soul actually is and what happens in the absence of it. But I'm sure with a bit of comedy thrown in and the quirky characters it should be a good film.

And then we have Surrogates:

<object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" width="550" height="350" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/UGwQ74cH5O0" /><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="550" height="350" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/UGwQ74cH5O0"></embed></object>

This has to be the best and worst trailer made. Best because it makes the film look so damn good but worst as it seems to show the best bits of the film. But as long as it didn't show how the film will end that's o.k. Also I can't see how Bruce can win I mean he is basically fighting humans in machine bodies, has no one seen 'Terminator'? Now imagine one human again all those terminators... No chance!! Well anyway it seems that this film has everything much like Bruce's other sci-fi flick 'Fifth Element'. That makes it uber cool!!!
