Well as no surprise I am not the only one blogging about the Baha'i Faith. It seems there are quite a few out there and my favourite so far is <a href="http://bahairants.com/" target="_blank">bahairants.com</a>, there is already a lot of crossover with this particular blog and I have only written two posts(one is in draft)!!! So I would recommend it as a good reference source as well as a personal blog, he(or she) seems to cover Ruhi very well and other aspects such as the teachings and upcoming news related to Baha'is.

Also it seems that someone is trying to collate all the Baha'i blogs in a searchable database,Â  <a href="http://www.bahainine.com/" target="_blank">bahainine.com</a> but it seems to be a bit flaky for now. But hopefully it should be a good source of blogging material.

Hopefully I can stand out as being the only one that is not a Baha'i blogging about Baha'is but then I haven't got an intended audience yet, so I don't mind if I am recognised or not.
