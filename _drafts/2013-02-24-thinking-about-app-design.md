First and foremost I am not a designer, I have no qualifications in design and until recently I had no interest in design. At least what I considered design to be. My definition at that time was that design was just aesthetics. It was what words posh, fancy people would spew out during art installations. It was the adjective after adjective describing the same thing ten different ways. It was what made people go, "ahh" during firework displays.

I like functionality. I don't really care what something looks like or how shiny it is , I just want it to do the things I want it do and I want it to be good at it. If it did look good then that was a bonus. This applied to almost everything, even websites. I detested the flash heavy days of the 2000's I longed for RSS feeds for all my sites with a picture followed by large swathes of text. Even my phone, I bought an iPhone because I got a good deal financially and I needed a phone with a good browser and email client. It didn't bother me it had won design awards.

But recently I had come to appreciate both aesthetics and functionality (partly due to some blogs I have been reading and part due to some long conversations with architecture buddies). I regarded the combination of both as the pinnacle of my new definition of design.

Now I am in the process of making an Android application and while I had been an admirer of design for a long time (in all it's definitions), it was now time to actually think about and implement this unfathomable beast.

In this project there are two of us producing this app. I will be mainly handling the application logic and the heavy lifting. My partner will be working on the php and front end graphics stuff. This was highlighted by the postive humming sound made when he saw the graphical drag and drop design which wrote some XML in the back.

So my role alone puts me at arms length from the design aspect. It seems I prefer this role rather then being the designer of this app. Needless to say I will be trying to think about and make decisions about how this should be designed.

The following posts in this category will follow and highlight some of the decisions made in making my android app with regards to design and more specifically functionality.
