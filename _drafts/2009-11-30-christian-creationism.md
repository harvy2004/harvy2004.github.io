Now I would say these set of video debates is Atheism vs. God but it seems that they just keep attacking evolution. Of course this is one of the defining points of Abrahamic religions. So I put this here just see what a good debate sounds like. I mean good as in full of drama and passion. But it does show how Atheists can argue their point strongly. Both Atheists  have researched their specialist fields and are not deterred if they need the other to answer. But saying that the Creationists did a good job, even though some points were blown out of the water, like actually understanding evolution.
