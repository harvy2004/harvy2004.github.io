For Lent I have decided to give up my home computer. But what exactly does this mean? (As I need a computer for work)<br /><br />So I have set some ground rules.<br /><ul><li>No using my own personal computer</li><li>No Facebook on any computer</li><li>No watching videos or TV(not that I have one)</li><li>Yes I can go to the cinema<br /></li><li>Yes I can use Twitter from iPhone or work<br /></li><li>Yes I can email from either my iPhone or at work</li><li>Yes I can use my iPhone for the odd browsing, but that is so annoying I wont do it that much anyway</li><li>Yes I can read blogs<br /></li></ul>I have noticed that has some major changes already, as I will note:<br /><ul><li>I am used to my PC turning on in the morning to play BBC News 24 but that doesn't happen now </li><li>I can't update my songs or videos on my iPhone </li><li>I am not using my computer for random stuff</li><li>I have cleared out my room of pc stuff, that leaves me a big desk of... nothing</li><li>I check my emails less often (a benefit so far)<br /></li></ul>
