With my new iPhone, I have discovered numerous tiltshift apps. First what is tiltshift?
Well it is now becoming a more mainstream use of camera work, not only in stills but now in actual moving footage. The best way it can be described though the actual pictures. Here are two from flickr:

I tried my hand at some tilt shift:

<a rel="attachment wp-att-444" href="http://blog.havinderatwal.com/2011/05/tiltshift/img_0051/"><img class="alignleft size-large wp-image-444" style="margin-left: 5px; margin-right: 5px;" title="IMG_0051" src="http://blog.havinderatwal.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/IMG_0051-1024x765.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="478" /></a> For a first attempt I thought it went pretty well. To get a good photo you have to follow some simple rules. The golden rule is to think in portal....toys, I mean toys. So the point of tilt shift is to make things look like toys. So if you think about how a picture of a toy normally looks like then you can get some brilliant tilt shift photos.

1) Height - Most pictures of toys
