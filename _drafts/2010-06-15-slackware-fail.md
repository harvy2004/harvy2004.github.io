After a recommendation from a friend I have decided to get my hands really dirty with some <a href="http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slackware">Slackware</a>. The original Linux distribution.

The first thing I am surprised about is the size of the install. I expected a much smaller distro size considering it was supposed to be the cleanest and non-bloated version of Linux ever. But oh well lets just plough on. So I have decided to install this on my ageing Toshiba laptop, as I am not going to be using it for university work any more :-) it would be good as a nice side project.

Well I already hit the first stumbling block and have already got device blocked. Basically getting wifi to work on Slackware is a pain in the butt. Since I am running it on my toshiba laptop, wifi is a must especially with the configuration work needed and pack dependancies. So the project has been stalled on the first hurdle. I looked around for any help but everyone was saying if the wifi adapter is not supported by the current linux drivers then don't bother or just stick with wired ethernet. And guess what my wireless adapter is not supported.

I guess this is going on hold until the community steps up.
