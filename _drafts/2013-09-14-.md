So there are a few posts on this but I wanted to make a how-to guide from scratch with little knowledge of electronics.

For this you will need :
<ul>
	<li>An arduino</li>
	<li>Minimus V2 (or 32K) board not V1 (16K)</li>
	<li>Windows machine</li>
	<li>Arduino IDE with example code</li>
</ul>
Now there are many guides with different variations, so this is not a catch-all guide. I am hoping a lot of people have the same set up as me, so this should be useful to most of you.

In this guide we will be using an arduino to flash the minimus board.

So first up is wiring the minimus up. Lovely Bob has a pinout of the minimus:

So you would want to attach (or surface solder) wires to SCK, GND, VCC, !RESET, MISO and MOSI. These wires will have to be long enough to attach to matching pins on an arduino.
