I like maps. Me buying my first mini A-Z map at university just as google maps was getting popular seemed a bit ridiculous. The idea of having a quick glance of where things where without lag and people able to gather people around a table was still enticing.

Later on I purchased a giant world map. All of us in the apartment including guests put down where we visited using nail varnish, the go to marker of choice. 

Last year I saw a post by [Dominik on his world wall map](https://www.dominik-schwarz.net/potpourri/worldmap/) (side note: I really need to work out how to layout blog posts like this). I was impressed by the quality and the detail looked great. While Dominik paid a lot of money for this, I'm sure I could do the same for cheaper and smaller. 

__Insert mockups here__

I started by working what map I wanted and what ratio it was to be in. I figured living in the city centre which is surrounded by a ring road would make good bounding area. I went for 16:9 ration as per the standard widescreen ration. The idea was to make it tablet-like on the wall, this should make it more friendly and accesible to anyone seeing it. This meant combining that ratio with the bounding area of the city ring road would lead to some wasted space around the sides, this was acceptable.

I went for the crude approach of print screening
