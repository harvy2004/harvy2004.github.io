I don't mean the wires or the electronic boxes, I'm talking about the effect on society as a whole. I know this question can't be fully answered but rather a collection of random thoughts that give a (hopefully) non-biased view which can ultimately lead to a conclusion on the future of society.

OK, so first up Internet is classed as communication. So it is basically a way of one person to communicate to another. It doesn't matter if your looking at websites, youtube videos or flicker pics. Its all the same thing and is in fact already imitated by society before the internet was even created. So instead of youtube we had independent cinema. Instead of web pages, we had business cards, yellow pages and mail order. As for flicker pics we had photo albums. (As you can see most of those old technologies are falling out of favour)

Since the dawn of time humans have had a need to communicate with one another(god knows why) and it is possible to run a business of just that idea alone. Yet at the same time it can actually be free (or cheap, ok just cheap not free). So now ideas like skype have come up and google is ^allowing^ free searches(imagine if they charged for every time you wanted to google something). This is basically old ideas being replaced by new technology but now with the added twist of philanthropist ideology.

So with more services moving to the internet another problem occurs, the idea of access to those services which eventually leads to the idea of an internet culture. Where at one time media used to be shared between the public it is now become personal. So we have libraries at one end and google scholar on the other, now both services do the same thing but in completely different ways.
