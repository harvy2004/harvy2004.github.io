One of the many interesting topics of discussion that came up was that Baha'is have to follow their government. Now when I heard this I didn't think much of it. It didn't make much sense to me if you took it literally and I thought it was one of those optional things.

Later on I questioned this further. Did they actually believe they should completely follow the government in everything they say? Well it seems so. But first I think I need to define some things.

What the scriptures say:
<blockquote>We must obey and be the well-wishers of the governments of the land, regard disloyalty unto a just king as disloyalty to God Himself and wishing evil to the government a transgression of the Cause of God.

(Abdu'l-Baha, Baha'i World Faith - Abdu'l-Baha Section, p. 439)</blockquote>
Later on the Guardian clarified this with the reason why:
<blockquote>We see, therefore, that we must do two things -- shun politics like the plague, and be obedient to the government in power in the place where we reside. We cannot start judging how a particular government came into power, and therefore whether we should obey it or not.

(Compilations, Lights of Guidance, p. 445)</blockquote>
With a bit more clarification on how far Baha'is should go to following their government:
<blockquote>For whereas the friends should obey the government under which they live, even at the risk of sacrificing all their administrative affairs and interests, they should under no circumstances suffer their inner religious beliefs and convictions to be violated and transgressed by any authority whatever.

(Compilations, Lights of Guidance, p. 446)</blockquote>
He then goes on to explain the difference between spiritual and administrative affairs. Even accepting the dissolution of meetings and literature, as long as it doesn't damage belief.
<blockquote>should the authorities in ... decide to-day to prevent Bahá'ís from holding any meeting or publishing any literature they should obey ... But, as already pointed out, such an allegiance is confined merely to administrative matter which if checked can only retard the progress of the Faith for some time. In matters of belief, however, no compromise whatever should be allowed, even though the outcome of it be death or expulsion."

(Compilations, Lights of Guidance, p. 446)</blockquote>
Now what do I think?

Firstly if this was followed and the government did decide to come down hard on Baha'is I think it would be very hard for them to carry out their Faith. Faith is propagated through meetings and literature, to take that away would be a severe crippling blow. And if the government started to lock up Baha'is just on their Faith who is there to justify to, that doing nothing is the right thing? I think that you should stand up for certain things and if they get that bad then even more so.

Now the paradox, what if the government tell you to do something that is morally or ethically wrong? Now it is quite clear there is some debate about that. As one Baha'i said ,"Bahai's have to obey a just government." But then just contradicts what the Guardian said, as he doesn't want politics to enter the equation and defining 'just' is a political nightmare. Luckly in this country it has not been that bad but other places like Iran and Egypt is another story.

Now Baha'is do set the ultimate example. If they want a world government they have to be prepared to follow it in every case and it seems by enacting this law now they are showing us that it can be done. But I think this not the right time or place, too many governements would easily take advantage of that. It almost as if they are pacifist in their ways to government policies and law.

I personally would like to one day say that I will follow the government in everything they say but only if they reach certain conditions, I won't go into all of them but it is kind of the idea of a utopian government.

So it would be representative of the people, there is very little or no corruption, it has the interests of everyone at heart. Now I know this probably won't happen in my life time, so while they don't completely satisfy my needs I am willing to participate in protests to what I think is wrong.

Now if the government does satisfy those conditions then I would have no problem as my needs are met and I would believe that I am part of the people and I would have far more respect for the people in power. And I believe by blindly following the government I am losing my right to voice my opinion on certain matters.
