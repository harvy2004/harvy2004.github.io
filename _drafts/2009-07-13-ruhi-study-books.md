When I first saw these I didn't know how important they were to the Baha'i Faith, as they are the persons first port of call in a formal process of learning the Baha'i Faith. When I attended the book study group I actually joined halfway through, so I missed most of the first part. I also failed to mention to the tutor that I was an Athiest, not that she minded when I did eventually tell her.

So I was literally thrown in the deep end, now back then I knew nothing of the Baha'i faith so I was tempted to just ask questions about pretty much anything apart from what was written in the books but I decided to sit back and just follow the lesson. I did get a quick crash course in the basics but it was very basic.

So we ploughed into the book and it was a surprising breath of fresh air, now I did expect some deep meaningful questions where we would have to spend hours (ok over exaggerating but you know what I mean) looking for the answers but that was not the case.

All the material needed was written in the books themselves, so you simply read the passage and then answered the questions for that passage. Now when it came to the questions they were simple questions in fact too simple, it now looked like the book was written for a pre-teen audience it was that simple. I immediately picked up this and was about to question the tutor but I let it go to see how it would pan out.

I eventually realised it was not the questions that were important, in fact we had spent more time debating the passages and more meaningful questions then what was given. It felt as if that was what the book was designed for.

This first book covered Understanding the Baha'i writings (maybe I should have gone through that first), Prayer and Life after Death. Now I entered towards the middle of Prayer and since I believe prayer is pointless for me it was more of learning how the passages were written and how they could be interpreted. Now the study group is setup so that no one person actually has more authority of another instead a person is set up to lead the group and control the discussion, so it does lead to a more bigger and longer lasting debate about question then if just one person knew everything and then interpreted the passages for everyine else. Now generally there was a consensus about what the passages meant but I interpreted them slightly differently but that just brought up more debate, which was good.

Now even though the tutor gave me my own personal copy of the book, I couldn't bring myself to write in them. I had nothing against the teachings been that written or even the questions being asked. But I felt that writing down the answers was pointless to me, since I didn't believe what I had written down. The tutor picked up on this (well it wasn't hard), I eventually told her I was an Athiest and I felt it wasn't right but she encouraged me to write it down anyway as it would help contribute to the group ethic. I felt that I had contributed to the group in terms of the discussions but this was a step too far.

But saying that, I did actually make it through to the end of the first book even though I missed a big chunk at the start and I missed a few bits in between for the weeks I couldn't attend. I still have the book (for some reason) and I was willing to give it back as was thinking it would be better for someone actually wanted to believe and contribute more fully to the study circle.Â  Eventually the group was ready to move onto the next book and again the tutor encouraged me to carry on, she even wanted me to finish the first book but again I refused. Instead she mentioned something earlier that I thought would be much more interesting, Firesides...
