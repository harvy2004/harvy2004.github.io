This is a post with some stats and comments on my personal experiance through the UK job market.
</p>

So I've decided to take the plunge and look for a new jobs. Here's some basic info about my last job hunt.

* It was 4 years ago
* I've programmed since university (I did a bit when I was a kid)
* My last job seeking took around 3 months
* The opportunities were a few per week


Now with my current job search I've taken some more tangible stats:

* 140 (80 unique) calls
* 8 text messages
* 38 emails

The kicker? That was in one day. They started to tail off the week after.

#What changed in the last 4 years?
