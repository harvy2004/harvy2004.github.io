So you've just had this brilliant idea of starting a blog. You think, "Wow, why haven't I done this before?" I need a place to record my thoughts and Facebook and Twitter is just not enough. You 'think' you have enough material to keep writing blog post after blog post. After all you think it's not that hard, I have used Facebook before. It's only writing some paragraphs on a page but it has to big enough, it has to have meaning, it needs substance and tell a whole story in one post.

So you sign up to wordpress or blogger or if you are lucky like me host your own blog install and start off with that inaugural blog post. Now depending on the person either a few days or weeks go by and another post is written but eventually you reach the 'block'. This 'block' is probably what is called 'writers block' in the world of authors but I call it a failed project.
<h3>So what happened?</h3>
Well many things really I have had this blog for a while now and before this I used Facebook notes for blogging as well as a separate blogger account. Also I know people who also started blogging at the same time as me (yes, real face people not people I met online) and they also hit the 'block'. In fact everyone I know personally has hit it at some point and few have gotten over it. I have actually kept a list of all my colleagues and friends blogs and visit now and again to see if anything has been updated. Some have died horribly and others have a very good user base.

So why does the 'block'Â  happen and how to stop it:

(note this are my own thoughts and probably have some backing in a study... somewhere)
<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Not twitter, scheduling</span></h3>
Ok first up this is not facebook or twitter. You don't visit your blog everyday nor do you post a 160 character blog post every 20 minutes, so don't treat it as such.

One step is to schedule your blog time, set a date in your calendar for once a week or once a month and then actually sit down and do it.

A blog is not the same throwaway media as twitter or facebook. Once you write a blog post it is searchable, its stored in a little archives tab, it is more persistent in both the front page view and on the site itself.
<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Stick to your subject and not just one</span></h3>
So many personal blogs have failed because they either talked about something which the blogger had no real idea of what they were talking about and even then only had that one thing to talk about.

One of my colleagues had a blog on just programming it started off well, he talked about his gripes and dislikes with certain IDE's (no mentioning here) and even did a book review of a programming book he just bought. But that was it. No more has been written since, so why? He had a subject but it wasn't enough and he had no scheduling. So I realised a personal blog can not survive if it just concentrates on one subject. Now the exception to this is if you know that subject well and can write about it but this questions the fact if this is really a personal blog post or a professional one-subject-idea wiki?

Now this doesn't work all the time as a lifelong blog can have many changing themes. As this is a personal blog post I set out categories covering religion, media and tech as these are the things I was into at the time but now things have changed. My religious studies ;-) have taken a back step but my media and tech hacking has gone up and also have random posts that could be in their own categories, so now my actual blog layout has to reflect my current life, so if I need to chop and change categories then so be it.

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Whos the audience? This is no Gizmodo</span></h3>
This is essentially what makes it yours. So yeah you are probably not a reporter for a gadget blog nor are you the head of your industry in soap making, so don't think your blog is an international news reel. It is your own personal blog and make it so. Anyone can regurgitate wikipedia in a blog post but it's your own opinion that counts. Again there was a blog that I know ran by a group of colleagues but all it posted was information from other internet sources on creative design. The idea was simple, it was to get those pieces of creative design in one place and have a discussion or at least some comments. But it died (I think it did, it might still be there) and other can easily get caught up. A blog has to be unique to survive.

One idea I took early on was to ignore the audience. If you try to tailor it a particular audience then 1) It's not authentic 2) You will get stuck in a niche. So instead I thought of it like a diary of my rambling thoughts but also interspersed it with special events that I happened to attend and news I have heard but I wanted to add my own twist. For just sharing basic news facebook and twitter was good enough.

Eventually close friends and family became the audience, which is fine as I can't see why a 26 year old Brazilian with a stamp fetish would be interested anyway.
<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Quality is king</span></h3>
Now I know a few bloggers that break the rule of scheduling (some break it very hard, months go by then 5 come at once) but I still check out their blog or even wish they blogged more because their content is really good. Mostly these are personal blogs but give a fascinating insight in the different ways people think and what they are thinking about. But what makes it for me is that I know these people personally, one actually spoke about how much they loved their mom and they don't normally show it and from the brief time I met her and her mom I could tell what kind of relationship they had. To see her express another side to her, that made it worth reading.

Another side to content quality is layout and style of writing. As many of the first time bloggers know writing a blog is actually harder then it looks, you want it to be worthy of the server it is hosted on and that is what turns away most bloggers in the first few posts. There has to be structure to your writing and everything has to fit. For example when I am writing a long blog post I consider fitting a picture to break up the post and hopefully some to illustrate the post some content within it, it needs to be colorful! No one on the internet wants to read really long posts as they start suffering from tl:dr syndrome and eventually bloggers realise they don't want to write long blog posts either. Do everyone a favor and keep post to a respectable length and break it down.
<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Most blogging is done when you are not blogging</span></h3>
Yes, this is a must for your blog to survive. Most posts I wrote took more then one sitting and almost all the time, I would script it out on paper first. Now this may seem OTT but just a little planning can save a lot of time on actually writing up the blog. Even this took two sittings to write.

Also to publish or not to publish? I'm a stickler for making sure my post is perfect before it goes out or making sure I get that picture I need before it makes it way to the internet but then I realised this software, this is a program, I can edit it later if I want. So now if I have the basics down then I will consider publishing it then amending afterwards.<span style="text-decoration: underline;">
