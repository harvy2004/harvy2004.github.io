Basically I am getting ready to do a full format of my machine in September for a few reasons.
<ul>
	<li>My machine is slowly dying, so I need to format it anyway to get rid of the crap</li>
	<li>I am getting ready for the Windows 7 release so repartitioning is required for a dual boot setup</li>
	<li>It is a good way to consolidate what you have and get rid of the junk programs you never use</li>
</ul>
Also every tech geek needs to list their favourite extensions.. So I am sorry for everyone that has to read this but it is a right of passage.
<ol>
	<li>Ad Block Plus - This is clearly the best Addon I have used</li>
	<li>CustomizeGoogle</li>
	<li>Fast Dial</li>
	<li>FlashBlock</li>
	<li>IE Tab</li>
	<li>Plain Text To Link</li>
	<li>Tiny Menu</li>
	<li>Tree style Tab</li>
	<li>TwitterFox</li>
	<li>FireBug</li>
</ol>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Dev AddOns</span>

Now that I am considering making my normal PC into a Dev machine as well. Here are some dev tools that are also must have for Firefox.
<ol>
	<li>Domain Details</li>
	<li>Reload Every</li>
	<li>Yet Another Windows Resizer</li>
	<li>Measure It</li>
</ol>
I have also just got a fresh install of Firefox 3.5 running so I have to build up my extensions again. Hmmmm maybe I should make this a page instead.
