Now since me and my family never bought beef or ate it, I never questioned why we didn't eat it. I went my merry way. I do remember though that my friends ate McDonald's beef burgers. So me and another friend (who also didn't eat beef) one day decided to question them about it. Now bear in mind we were pretty young then so the responses like, "it is not same kind of beef as the one you buy from stores" or "it is not real beef" were not really valid.

But it didn't bother me, as MacDonald's was probably the only place that this happened. And I hardly went there as it was. So more years passed and there was an incident where I accidentally ate some beef. Now at the time I didn't know cottage pie meant beef pie. So I had to say some prayers to God... Don't ask how that happened. Again I was still young so I didn't question anything or even know what to believe at that time. I remember the explanation I was told was that our holy texts that we should be vegetarian but if we do eat meat then we shouldn't eat the cow.

Then came university, here I learned that nowhere in our holy scriptures did it say that we couldn't eat beef. Now what it does say, is that we should be vegetarian and if we do eat meat it should not be killed in a ritualistic fashion. Now of course there is a bit of contradiction between how can it say be vegetarian but at the same time give guidance on how meat should be prepared... But you will find that common in some of the teachings.

Guru Nanak put it best:
<blockquote><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: x-small;">Only fools argue            whether to eat meat or not. They don't understand truth nor do they            meditate on it. Who can define what is meat and what is plant? Who knows            where the sin lies, being a vegetarian or a non- vegetarian? (Malhar)</span></blockquote>
But I am digressing for that is an argument for meat(ism)/vegetarianism. The point was that nowhere did it mention that beef is singled out. So where did this beef thing come from?

Well Guru Nanak was a Hindu and Hindus do believe that the cow is sacred, so of course when Hindus started to convert to Sikhism they will have kept their own traditions with them but there should be a time when these should pass out of the culture and religion, as Sikhism (tries) to do away with unnecessary rituals or traditions. But it seems now that this tradition still carries on to this day (over 300 years later)!!!

Another explanation is that a certain political party believes that Hindus and Sikhs are the in fact the same religion, so they try to propagate that fact by getting Sikhs to not eat beef. Now I have not seen any sign of this or it could be that it happened a long time ago that it has already had the desired effect and there is no need to to propagate it further. But now that is going to conspiracy theories, so there is no point dwelling on that. The point is that people need to be educated in what their religion teaches and not be held down by tradition, such is the case in many religions.

So how did I deal with it? Well I tried to eat beef and had a very hard time succeeding. An incident occurred in a restaurant where I was with some people who are of a varied sort. The first question came was if anyone had any dietary requirements. I didn't say anything, some people pointed out that they were vegetarian. Now as the dishes were chosen, it seemed that there was too much choice (somehow). So again the question went around if anyone had dietary requirements. Now the woman asking was persistent for some reason, I guess I will never know why. But eventually my childhood instincts came out and I blurted, "No beef."

And there were other incidents where this has happened but there have been times where I had no problem. I think it goes like, if I was served beef I would eat it but if i was given the option then I would opt-out. I don't think I would ever buy beef from the supermarket and prepare it. So it is quite clear it is very hard to shake off early education.

But does that matter? I mean I eat all the other meats, so I think just not having beef has affected me in anyway. If I started I don't think it would change my life either. But then I am giving the signal that "I don't eat beef" with no justification. If people find out I am a Sikh then they will think that "Sikh's don't eat beef." Which is untrue... so I have to eat it to show Sikhs that it is ok to eat beef and to show the everyone else that "Sikhs can eat beef."

Is that a good reason to eat something ? At the same time why should I start to eat something that I clearly don't need?
