&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;october-box.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;yes-plant-protein-bar&quot;&gt;YES. Plant protein bar&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surprisingly tasty and crunchy. Would buy again. Had the almond version.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;maltesers-instant-hot-chocolate&quot;&gt;Maltesers Instant Hot Chocolate&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s hot chocolate, what’s not to love. I ignored their recommendation of using water and it was still good. But I prefer my hot chocolate powder from Lidl.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;reeses-peanut-butter-minis&quot;&gt;Reese’s Peanut Butter Minis&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Too good. We devoured them in under 20 min.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;flapjack&quot;&gt;Flapjack&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tina - Good for a lazy snack. But it’s bigger than one thinks, so not for mini-peckish moments&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;chocolate-crepes&quot;&gt;Chocolate crepes&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tina - A bit dry and tasteless. Warm they were definitely better but still not great&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;costa-coffee&quot;&gt;Costa Coffee&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harvy - Pretty much like millicano, I suspect you can’t improve on nearly-instant coffee anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;cashew-and-oat-cookie&quot;&gt;Cashew and Oat Cookie&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harvy - Great little cookiie, wish it was bigger but then it’s good portion control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;pretzels&quot;&gt;Pretzels&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;attack-a-snak&quot;&gt;Attack a Snak&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;kitkat-senses&quot;&gt;Kitkat senses&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;simmering-september-box.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;hartleys-jelly-pot&quot;&gt;Hartley’s Jelly Pot&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tina - “There is always room for Jello” and Bill Murray was right. Nice jello, like all jello.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Harvey - I don’t think I had this&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;mc-vitiess&quot;&gt;Mc Vities’s&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Normally not a fan of orange flavoured cookies but these were nice. Good mix of crunchiness, gooiness and chocolate taste.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Harvey - Tina have you been eating all these? Pretty sure I didn’t have this either. /whispers I did it was great. Slightly chewy but the taste and texture made up for that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;emily-veg-thins&quot;&gt;Emily Veg Thins&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interesting alternatives for crisps, crunchy and nice tastes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Harvey - I stayed away from these.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;peters-yard-original-sourdough-crispbread&quot;&gt;Peter’s Yard Original Sourdough Crispbread&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nice take on the cracker, good with smelly cheese and a drop of sour marmalade. Yum yum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;fulfil-chocolate-hazelnut-whip-bar&quot;&gt;FULFIL Chocolate Hazelnut Whip Bar&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tina - Nice and smooth, very indulgent and not too bad on the calorie count.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Harvy - Agree very smooth and just the right mix of textures and flavours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;whitworths-chocolate-biscuit--hazelnut-treat-mix&quot;&gt;Whitworths Chocolate Biscuit &amp;amp; Hazelnut Treat Mix&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tina - The bits and pieces were not bad, but the mix of raisins and nuts and chocolate freaks me out. I want to know if it is crispy, sweet or gooey and salty before i bite on it, even if I chuck them down without looking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Harvy - Really like the mix of different but complimentary snacks. Just shove a load in your mouth and let it all mix up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;thatchers-cloudy-lemon-cider&quot;&gt;Thatchers Cloudy Lemon Cider&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Harvy - Surprisingly a refreshing drink that’s good for the summer days/nights. Reminds me of a bottled &lt;a href=&quot;https://germanfoods.org/recipes/radler/&quot;&gt;radler from germany&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;chicken-yakisoba&quot;&gt;Chicken Yakisoba&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;more-maple-syrup-this-time-mini&quot;&gt;More Maple syrup, this time mini&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did we even use this? It’s probably just disappeared&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;vegetable-barley-soup&quot;&gt;Vegetable Barley soup&lt;/h5&gt;

Shout out to Alan who put in our house as we were away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;hot-hot-august-spread.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;harvy&quot;&gt;Harvy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feeling a bit lighter than other boxes, so was just expecting no drinks but suprise! Iced coffee. To be honest I’m not that excited with this one, between the chai tea and chai breakfast blend going to the puds sweets, there’s not much inspiration here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;swizzels-puds&quot;&gt;Swizzels Puds&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Harvy - I didn’t feel that these wanted production, I’ve had a lot of chewy streets and especially refreshers which this comes very close to. The different flavours were a mixed bag. Sticky toffee I think didn’t work out well and the rest were palatable. Probably won’t buy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tina - Imagine a colourful blob made almost entirely of sugar with an artificial hint of a flavour of some popular desserts. There you go. You never get all of the slowly melting stuff out of your teeth again. But it is so sweet, do you really want to? (Not recommended by 100/10 dentists)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;boundless&quot;&gt;Boundless&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Harvy - The only thing I remember from this is the hit of chilli after you finish the nuts. I’m not sure why this is a thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;simpleas&quot;&gt;Simpleas&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Harvy - Tina didn’t want it as it had vinegar. The pea taste for me was just overpowered by the salt and vineger and texture was just like eating mush. Not a fan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;capsicana---cooking-paste&quot;&gt;Capsicana - cooking paste&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tina - We tried a variety of the added recipe and it was rather nice. A different taste to the usual cooking pastes. Not too spicy and tastes almost naturally. Intense smell during cooking. Would buy again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Harvy - I only tasted the end result but I was impressed, would also buy and then make Tina cook with again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;sunny-fruit-mix-up&quot;&gt;Sunny fruit mix up&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No comments, I guess it was just meh then.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;pickup&quot;&gt;Pickup&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tina - I know them from other countries, and they are a nice snack. Had the hazelnut one which had soft chocolate in the middle. Looking forward to the white and milk chocolate versions too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;iced-coffee&quot;&gt;Iced Coffee&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;cold-infused-tea&quot;&gt;Cold Infused “Tea”&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;yet-another-chai-latte&quot;&gt;Yet another Chai Latte&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;protein-bar&quot;&gt;Protein Bar&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;porridge&quot;&gt;Porridge&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tina - Good but how bad can porridge be?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;summer-july-spread.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;nesquik&quot;&gt;Nesquik&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tina - 5 stars for effort, as it doesn’t have artificial sweetener, less sugar and even the package is paper based and can be recycled. We compared it with a chocolate powder we already had at home, and it unfortunately didn’t do well in comparison. Not bad, but not great either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;nativa&quot;&gt;Nativa&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tina - Tested this in a drink for sweetening. I just wished the package would have a warning, that it is more potent than sugar. Would have used less than a full teaspoon. So sparsely dosed it does the job with sweetening your drinks and foods. They say you can use it for baking as well. While that is great news, it seems very experimental without a conversion ratio. Wouldn’t mind a sweet cake without sugar, but could end up with way too much or not enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;skinny-food-sauces&quot;&gt;Skinny food sauces&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tina - We got 4 sachets of sauces and sirups from this company. I tried the sirup for a Latte but it was hardly detectable in sweetness or flavour. Great that is has hardly any calories, but without any flavour not the best trade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Harvy - It’s all horrible, don’t buy it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;golden-creek-maple-syrup&quot;&gt;Golden Creek (Maple syrup)&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tina - For people who can’t live without syrup on their pancakes definitely a good option. Sticky and sweet as advertised. The non-maple part is dominating, making it a bit too sweet for my taste.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Harvy - I don’t normally buy syrup but was pretty nice on pancake, which I think is the only thing they can be used for? I can’t remember what normal syrup tastes like, so can’t compare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;premier-protein-chocolate-brownie-flavoured-protein-bar&quot;&gt;Premier Protein (chocolate brownie flavoured protein bar)&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tina - Tastes like it looks, sweet, dense and good flavour of chocolate. Good portion for when you are hungry but too busy or too lazy to actually make yourself a sandwich. Good after gym or outdoor snack. Available only at ocado and WHSmith travel, so won’t see any of them for a while.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;wunda-pea-drink&quot;&gt;Wunda (pea drink)&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tina - If you are used to Oat and Almond drinks, this is just as good or bad, depending on what your experience was with Oat and Almond drinks. With 1.99 per litre definitely on the pricey side even compared to other plant based milk replacements. 
Harvy - I already dislike oatly and this is probably worse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;bebeto-sugar-candy-box&quot;&gt;Bebeto (sugar candy box)&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tina - Like all sugary candy which comes in small portions in large boxes, one easily gets hooked and keeps on eating without reason. The mix of sour, sugar and the refreshing artificial flavours of the different items make it fun. Unfortunately the least fun item makes up 50% of the whole box. Was fun to eat, but probably would buy again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Harvy - Great little sugar box but just too much of the watermelon sweet, maybe a few more different flavours. Probably would get it at the right price but pretty sure supermarket do own label versions and I don’t buy those sooooo….&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;plant-pops-popped-lotus-seeds&quot;&gt;Plant pops (popped Lotus seeds)&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tina - I heard about lotus seeds and was very excited about this. But once they are popped like sweetcorn kernels and flavoured with peanut, it’s hard to find an original taste. Definitely a fun snack and good alternative for popcorn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;pravha&quot;&gt;Pravha&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Harvy - Surpisingly refreshing pilsner, fairly light as well and filled up my 1 litre jug quite nicely. I could be seen drinking the bigger bottles for a nice summer beer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;chai-latte&quot;&gt;Chai Latte&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Harvy - Finally got around to this a few months later. Tasted pretty much like most chai lattes. I’m used to the starbucks supermarket versions and it was pretty much it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;manilife&quot;&gt;Manilife&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Harvy - It’s just peanut butter but barely enough to cover toast. What was the USP here?&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Harvinder Atwal</name><email>blog@harvinderatwal.com</email></author><category term="food" /><summary type="html">The July Box arrived.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Yummy yummy June box</title><link href="https://harvinderatwal.com/yummy-yummy-june-box/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Yummy yummy June box" /><published>2020-06-12T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2020-06-12T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://harvinderatwal.com/yummy-yummy-june-box</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://harvinderatwal.com/yummy-yummy-june-box/">&lt;p&gt;The June Box arrived and was looking good at first sight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;yummy-yummy-june-spread.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;tina&quot;&gt;Tina&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The big bottle of Gin Fizz was dominating in the box, just a shame it was pink. Nevertheless, looking forward to taste it, after cooling it of course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were also several snack items, which waited for that afternoon motivation plunge to be devoured - Chickpea puffs, fruit jellies, roasted corn and sweet cereal and marshmallow bars. There was also another bottle of salad dressing, which - together with the two from last month - mean, we better start eating salads. We will have to fight the slugs in the veg-bed more rigorously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;harvy&quot;&gt;Harvy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few things have caught my eye but there’s also a few that I’m not bothered about (yet another salad dressing).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s “Attack a Snak” which reminds me of lunchables, they were a desperation food but would probably have it again, so interested to see how these turn out.
I’m looking forward to Baru (?) because who doesn’t like chocolate marshmallow in a bar. Noisy snacks looks intreg they boast they use double the flavouring of other snacks. Is that a good thing?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;superfruit-jellies&quot;&gt;Superfruit Jellies&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overwhelming smell to the point of artificial. The choice of flavours was :shaky hands but not trump: It just seemed to break up in your mouth but not really melt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;baru-chocolate-marshmallow-bar&quot;&gt;Baru Chocolate Marshmallow Bar&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looks like expected for a Marshmallow chocolate bar, nice and soft. A little too sweet for the generous size, but marshmallow lovers will probably like it. It was supposed to be Chai Latte flavour, but there wasn’t much of it, which I actually preferred.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;le-joli&quot;&gt;Le Joli&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically flavoured sparkling water. Which has never tasted nice… ever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;attack-a-snack&quot;&gt;Attack A Snack&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Small nachos with some overpowering bbq chipoltle sauce (way too much sugar as well) and not sure why they included the cream sauce as well. Can’t really recommend this, like cinema nachos but worse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;noisy-corn&quot;&gt;Noisy corn&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heavily flavoured corn, works pretty well actually. Good little snack but I feel it might too pricey when released&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;ollys-olives&quot;&gt;Olly’s Olives&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not sure what the product is supposed be here. It’s just olives with garlic and basil. I mean the olives were good but you can find this in different variation from stock supermarket food in the deli section. Snack sized which worked in its favour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;lizis-granola-high-protein-40g&quot;&gt;Lizi’s Granola High Protein (40g)&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The miniture package is a harsh reminder of how small a “recommended portion” really is. However, the stuff in my bowl looked promising, nicely brown coloured, suggesting a good roast or the grains. But once you add the milk everthing starts to float. Turns out, most is puffed grains, not much to chew on. Taste was plesant but the overall impression falls behind the high expectantions I got from their cover picture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Harvy thought it needed more sugar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;nine-bar&quot;&gt;Nine Bar&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good meal replacement options for a hectic day or after exercise. Good flavour and the full stomach feeling you get from dense energy bars like this. A bit too much for a light snack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;gregorys-tree&quot;&gt;Gregory’s Tree&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Essentially the healthier version of fruit twists? I’m not sure why these exist to be honest. I’m sure the standard full fat version costs less and I think they are supposed to bad for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;hippeas&quot;&gt;Hippeas&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Liking the big crunchy pieces. It was vinegar flavour but it wasn’t as overpowering as your normal salt and vinegar snack but would look forward to other flavours. Kinda reminded me of wotsits but less chessy, and I assume it’s more healthy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;overall&quot;&gt;Overall&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;harvy-1&quot;&gt;Harvy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Really liked the marshmellow bar (of course who wouldn’t), I think the unexpected winner here was the noisy corn snack.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Harvinder Atwal</name><email>blog@harvinderatwal.com</email></author><category term="food" /><summary type="html">The June Box arrived and was looking good at first sight.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">One crazy estate agent Part 2</title><link href="https://harvinderatwal.com/one-crazy-estate-agent-part-2/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="One crazy estate agent Part 2" /><published>2017-06-08T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2017-06-08T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://harvinderatwal.com/one-crazy-estate-agent-part-2</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://harvinderatwal.com/one-crazy-estate-agent-part-2/">&lt;p&gt;Weeks later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After changing solictors, as they were not on the approved list for my mortgage provider (Who knew… more red tape!),the estate agent didn’t like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I need a call immediately, I have just called your solicitor for an update and been told that they are no longer acting for you. It would have been polite to call and let me know about this, I will need the details of a new solicitor today.
Please call the office asap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was after I email a few days before to tell them of this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anywho. I already had another one lined up. Again dates: Friday 28th April to instruct them to work for us, we got the papers the next and had a read though. We decided that we should go down and hand everything in on the same day. Scheduled that for 9th May.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But here’s the estate agent again, the day before my visit:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I’ve spoken to your solicitors, they have informed me that they are not able to undertake any work on your behalf as they are awaiting the return of your formal instruction letter and payment for search fees. They documents were sent to you on the 2nd of May (last Tuesday).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;They have received the draft contract and all required documents from the vendors solicitor and are aware you are taking a mortgage from Yorkshire Building Society, they said this lender is generally very swift at releasing the mortgage funds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I am pressing you to move swiftly as the vendor starts his new job on the 5th of June and needs this to be completed by that date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we have a date but I was unsure about why she was telling me what my solictor has done for me. I mean thanks for the update but is this supposed to me make me go faster?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I say that we are meeting tomorrow to sort out the paperwork.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Brilliant, thank you for letting me know.
Would the 5th of June as a date for completion work for you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point I consult as to what to do here. Is this legally binding? I decide to hold off and say I will talk to my solictor as to what dates can be done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, the estate agent:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Please let me know if this date is feasible asap – so that I can confirm with the vendor and allow him to book in his removal company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I still hold off but never actually reply. She never chased up for that date. I guess it wasn’t important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The solictor starts working and then another email from the estate agent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Dear Mr. Atwal,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I have also left a message for your solicitor regarding the email below from the vendors solicitor. As you are aware we are hoping to complete in this sale at the end of next week. If you could chase your solicitor for me that would be very much appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What followed was a thread of confusing emails between the solictors. It seemed everything was going to plan and I wasn’t even sure what to ask my solictor. Hmm confusing, it seems that there was a sense of desperation of the vendor which was coming though the estate agent but it was compromising communication between all parties. This process required the upmost clarity between all parties, especially for a first time buyer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More fun from the estate agent:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Dear &amp;lt;solicitor&amp;gt;,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The vendors solicitor has come back to me since the last email, she said she has finally received your enquires. She can get these all back to you by Tuesday. Can you prepare your files and arrange for your client to come in and sign the contracts next week please. Ideally we want to complete next Friday. /&lt;vendors solictor=&quot;&quot;&gt; has made me aware that this the pace at which you are working that is unlikely. We are therefore giving you notice that we wish to exchange contracts no later than next Friday and complete the following week as early as possible.&lt;/vendors&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now the solictor was not getting happy with this tone from the estate agent. They had never seen this behaviour before and wanted to give us an update to make sure nothing was out of place and discussed different theories like, was this was a new estate agent, maybe they didn’t know how buying a house worked (that theory was shot down, as apparently they had 10 years experience). With an unhappy solicitor and a pushy estate agent can get it get worse?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While this was happening I was still waiting for a mortgage offer. This was then made apparent to the estate agent. Uh oh.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Harvinder Atwal</name><email>blog@harvinderatwal.com</email></author><summary type="html">Weeks later.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">One crazy estate agent Part 1</title><link href="https://harvinderatwal.com/one-crazy-estate-agent/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="One crazy estate agent Part 1" /><published>2017-05-10T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2017-05-10T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://harvinderatwal.com/one-crazy-estate-agent</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://harvinderatwal.com/one-crazy-estate-agent/">&lt;p&gt;There’s a few moments in your life where you have to deal with someone who just doesn’t have a handle on humanity. 
This is one of those times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Me and my girlfriend just got back from a viewing and agreed this is house we could move into. Let’s put an offer in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the phone call with the estate agents, something seemed a bit off. I had offered £10k less then the asking. The estate agent, who just happened to be the MD said if I could offer the asking price she can accept it striaght away. I held off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Surprise! The next day an offer came in from a potential buyer for the asking price but they didn’t give it away, instead I was offered to do…. something?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“So what can I do here?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Well it’s up to you.” I could sense some smirking in the voice but maybe it was me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I’ll get back to you.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We decided it put in the asking price, still dubious but we could accept the cost over a long mortgage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Surprise! 30 minutes later the vendor accepted our offer… Hmmmmm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Timelines are going to be interesting here. It’s the 28th March (Day 1).
An email on the same day:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I will now need solicitors details, please let me know if you would like me to recommend some good solicitors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ok great I think, just send me a list. My response:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;That’s great!
I don’t have any solicitors lined up, so if you could send me a list that would be helpful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;No problem, please speak to these people and let me know who you are working with as soon as you have selected one, thank you.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;list of=&quot;&quot; solicitors=&quot;&quot;&gt;
To make life easier I will ask them each to contact you with a quote.
&lt;/list&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wut? Umm thanks for sending my information across. Anyway it’s now Day 2, 9:21 a.m.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Good morning,
I just wondered if you have selected a solicitor to work with on this purchase?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I explain that from yesterday only one has got back to me and they couldn’t work with my mortgage provider. I will get back once I have made a decision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4:04 p.m.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;How you getting on? Any progress with speaking to solicitors?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I ignore them…. for today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Day 3. Ahh what a nice morning. Oh what’s this? An email from 8:51 a.m.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Good morning Harvinder,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;As I explained on Tuesday you were selected over the other asking price offer as I was under the impression you could move more quickly on this purchase. The vendor is now telling me that we should take the other offer if we don’t have solicitors on file this morning. Can you please come back to me in the next hour with your choosen firm!  I don’t want to have to terminate the sale so soon, but we will need this to move along swiftly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I look forward to hearing from you soon, if you need my advice please do call the office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I explain I have now chosen a solictor and give the law firm details. A bit annoyed she is using this mystery buyer to push the sale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;11 minutes later…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Just spoken to &amp;lt;Law firm&amp;gt; and they don’t seem to have a file for you…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I give her the case number and suddenly get a flurry of emails from the estate agent with my solictors details which even I didn’t know and an agreement to proceed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then nothing…. for weeks.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Harvinder Atwal</name><email>blog@harvinderatwal.com</email></author><summary type="html">There’s a few moments in your life where you have to deal with someone who just doesn’t have a handle on humanity.

Me buying my first mini A-Z map at university just as google maps was getting popular seemed a bit ridiculous but the idea of having a quick glance of where things were without waiting for  a page to load and the physicality of it still made it enticing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later on, I purchased a giant world map. All of us in the flat including guests put down where we visited using nail varnish, the go-to student marker of choice, and this lead to a rich story of journeys and ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last year I saw a post by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dominik-schwarz.net/potpourri/worldmap/&quot;&gt;Dominik on his world wall map&lt;/a&gt; (side note: I really need to work out how to layout blog posts like that). I was impressed by the quality and the detail looked great. While Dominik paid a lot of money for this, I’m sure I could do the same for cheaper and smaller.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally I wanted a purpose for the map. Dominik is using it to place markers for places he travelled to and for me a smaller map of just Manchester would be ideal but marking all the places I visited wouldn’t be enough. I decided on placing markers for food places (takeaway and eat-in) and then working on a way to label and review each one with someway of making that review available to people looking at the map.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/wallmap_manchester.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;wallmap_design&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wall map design&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started by working what map I wanted and what ratio it was to be in. I figured living in the city centre which is surrounded by a ring road would make good bounding area. I went for 16:9 ration as per the standard widescreen ration. The idea was to make it tablet-like on the wall, this should make it more friendly and accessible to anyone seeing it. This meant combining that ratio with the bounding area of the city ring road would lead to some wasted space around the sides, that was acceptable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing I needed to do was get the image of the map. Dominik used google maps applauding its correct amount of detail and I had to agree with him. Google maps was the best way to get this done without much input. I screenshot-ed each segment with some overlap between each area and then looked for a way to stitch it together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I remember using an amazing bit of software called PhotoSynth when I was taking panoramic shots but without a camera that could stitch them together. You basically took the photos separately and PhotoSynth would stick it all together for you. I figured this would work well here, essentially swapping a photo for a map but the concept is the same. This software did it well. Oh I forgot to mention, it’s full name is Microsoft PhotoSynth….. Yes they released a product and it just worked. That’s probably the more amazing story here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/wallmap_collated_areas.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;wallmap_collated_areas&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately the whole of the ring road didn’t quite make it in the final cut but that’s ok. It was part of Manchester most people avoided anyway :-P&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I had a high res photo of Manchester, the next step :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Getting it ready for print&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First up the materials. Now Dominick used KAPA(also known as Foamex) which is basically a foam board . He then had the printed design of his world map plastered on it, even using the local decorator to stick it on like wallpaper. I was not going to do that. I opted for the we-will-print-on-the-kapa-for-you service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found a few services online in the UK that can do this, I went with Pixart Printing. As this was the first time I was doing this I didn’t want to spend too much money, so I went with the thinnest Foamex board they have. This also meant I didn’t have to worry about how to mount, as I would just go for Command Wall Hooks which would hopefully hold all the weight I need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Essentially to make sure your design translates to their requirement you can download a PDF which has the guidelines for your preferred size then make sure your image fits within those guidelines as well as allowing some bleed around the edges for when they cut.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/wallmap_pixart_template.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;wallmap_pixart_template&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Getting the resolution right was important was well. I deliberately tried to look for the highest resolution printing amiable as maps tend to be viewed close up at some point. Pixart supported up to 300dpi for small and 100dpi on larger media which is not really photo quality but it should be enough to be legible for the size I want. I uploaded a 300dpi file and hoped they would treat it accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spec for the rest of the board:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th&gt; &lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt; &lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Material&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Foamex&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Height&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;100cm&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Width&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;133cm&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Depth&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;0.3cm&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Weight&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;2.128kg&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This gives me a ratio of 4:3 which is what I needed for my tablet-like board. The weight means that a bunch of Command hooks can hold it quite easily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had this sent off and printed, for it to arrive with me then realising I had to carry the damn thing back to my apartment. It was awkward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once home, I simply put 4 Command hooks on each corner forgoing the metal hooks they come bundled with as that would require screw mounting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/wallmap_onwall.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;wallmap_onwall&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It took very little effort to complete the mounting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall I was very satisfied with the print, even if it was directly printed on the board as opposed to paper. The names were legible, roads and bus stops could be seen and most crucially there was enough scale to be able to pinpoint restaurant locations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next problem I had was how do I identify the restaurants and label them accordingly? There were a few iterations of ideas, ranging from small RFIDs and QR codes to simple marker and a book attached to the wall. I settled on coloured dots for easy contrasting of each food venue with a simple numbering system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And for the complicated part…. A web app to search the number and return the review for the place you are looking for. This development will be covered in another post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final part was to personalise it with the coloured dots and slowly get my reviews written.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just want to pen down some aims for 2016 and see where I get to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most people go crazy with resolutions. One guy over New Years’ made 17! I think that’s a bit crazy, so I am keeping to a simple, short list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Read more books. Mark Zuckerberg claimed to have read 2 a month. That seems like a good target.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Learn to ski (properly). I have started this already but I want to get good and I’ve barely had any lessons.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Learn Spanish. I am planning a Cuba trip soon. I have also signed up for Spanish lessons starting this month. Duolingo shoud also augment this.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Measure my achievements. I heard about this over New Years: the act of just trying to measure goals will actually improve how you reach them. Hopefully end up making a list like &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.fogus.me/2015/12/29/the-best-things-and-stuff-of-2015/&quot;&gt;this guy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Upgrade all the things. I have more disposable income, so time to buy the same things but smaller and better.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Improve health. More specifically train myself to stop getting any more back pain, which has been up and down last year.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is also about doing less of things:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Less martial arts. Yep, this was low on my list but I still keep going sporadically. I think it is time to dump the martial art side of my training and stick to fitness and core exercises.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Less TV shows. Again this was slipping already but still managed a few seasons of House Of Cards and started on Red Dwarf. Now moving to just a few mini-series, like Sherlock or Luther.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Reduce my ownership footprint. Last time I checked I owned about two cars worth of stuff, time to get that down to one car.&lt;/li&gt;
