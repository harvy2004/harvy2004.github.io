This may sound trivial but I am assured it's not.

I've decided to make my own shoe rack. Yes one of those pretty trivial and simple things, that you can buy from IKEA for about Â£6.

Now this is really for one reason, although there could be others surrounding it: I want to build something out of wood. Can I become a carpenter?

As with any project I would like to fill a need, so here we go:

* We have a space for it to go: ![apartment_corner](/assets/apartment_corner.jpg)
* I have to decide the material, preferably some darkish wood
* I'm going to need a lot of help and resource: cue the call to my local hackspace
* Design is now very important... Ah I just found my pinterest login.
