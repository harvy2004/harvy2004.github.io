Feeling a bit lighter than other boxes, so was just expecting no drinks but suprise! Iced coffee. To be honest I'm not that excited with this one, between the chai tea and chai breakfast blend going to the puds sweets, there's not much inspiration here.

##### Puds

Harvy - I didn't feel that these wanted production, I've had a lot of chewy streets and especially refreshers which this comes very close to. The different flavours were a mixed bag. Sticky toffee I think didn't work out well and the rest were palatable. Probably won't buy.

##### Boundless

Harvy - The only thing I remember from this is the hit of chilli after you finish the nuts. I'm not sure why this is a thing.

##### Pea snack

Harvy - Tine didn't want it as it had vinegar. The pea taste for me was just overpowered by the salt and vineger and texture was just like eating mush. Not a fan.
