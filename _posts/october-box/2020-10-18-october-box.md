##### YES. Plant protein bar
Surprisingly tasty and crunchy. Would buy again. Had the almond version. 

##### Maltesers Instant Hot Chocolate
It’s hot chocolate, what’s not to love. I ignored their recommendation of using water and it was still good. But I prefer my hot chocolate powder from Lidl.

##### Reese’s Peanut Butter Minis
Too good. We devoured them in under 20 min. 

##### Flapjack

##### Chocolate crepes

##### Costa Coffee

##### Cashew and Oat Cookie

##### Pretzels

##### Attack a Snak

##### Kitkat senses

##### Brioche Burger Buns
