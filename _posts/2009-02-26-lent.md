For Lent I have decided to give up my home computer. But what exactly does this mean? (As I need a computer for work)
So I have set some ground rules.
* No using my own personal computer
* No Facebook on any computer
* No watching videos or TV(not that I have one)
* Yes I can go to the cinema
* Yes I can use Twitter from iPhone or work
* Yes I can email from either my iPhone or at work
* Yes I can use my iPhone for the odd browsing, but that is so annoying I wont do it that much anyway
* Yes I can read blogs
* I have noticed that has some major changes already, as I will note:
* I am used to my PC turning on in the morning to play BBC News 24 but that doesn't happen now 
* I can't update my songs or videos on my iPhone 
* I am not using my computer for random stuff
* I have cleared out my room of pc stuff, that leaves me a big desk of... nothing
* I check my emails less often (a benefit so far)
