I just want to pen down some aims for 2016 and see where I get to.

### Keeping it simple

Most people go crazy with resolutions. One guy over New Years' made 17! I think that's a bit crazy, so I am keeping to a simple, short list.

1. Read more books. Mark Zuckerberg claimed to have read 2 a month. That seems like a good target.
2. Learn to ski (properly). I have started this already but I want to get good and I've barely had any lessons.
3. Learn Spanish. I am planning a Cuba trip soon. I have also signed up for Spanish lesson starting this month, so that should kickstart me.
4. Measure my achievements. I heard about this over New Years: the act of just trying to measure goals will actually improve how you reach them. A bit like this guy http://blog.fogus.me/2015/12/29/the-best-things-and-stuff-of-2015/
5. Upgrade all the things. I have come into more disposableincome, so time to buy things that are smaller and better.


This is also about doing less of things:

1. Less martial arts. Yep, this was low on my list but I still keep going sporadically. I think it is time to dump the martial art side of my training and stick to fitness.
2. Less TV shows. Again this was slipping already but still managed a few seasons of House Of Cards and started on Red Dwarf. Now moving to just a few mini-series, like Sherlock or Luther.
3. Reduce my ownership footprint. Last time I checked I owned about two cars worth of stuff, time to get that down to one car.
